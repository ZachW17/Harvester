/*
 * public interface Menu
 * @author Zach Whitman
 * 
 * Version:
 *      $1.0.1.Bada$$
 * 
 * Revisions:
 * Added the drawableGameCompononents override methods to the class so the menus could inherit from them
 * Added a rectangle to replace the vecotors so the buttons are clickable
 * Added a previous and current mouse state to make sure you don't fuck with the system when clicking
 * 
 * Did NOT get to GameOver or GamePause yet, I will finish MainMenu first before hand
 *
